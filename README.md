This repository contains the basic code for "Queer Encodings: An NLP Study of Challenged Books in the United States." It does not include the BERTopic model
trained for the project, the digital editions of texts on which the model was trained, nor the datasets from the American Library Association for the
metadata, the latter two due to copyright and privacy concerns. Please contact Elliot Galvis for access to the original BERTopic model used in the project.
